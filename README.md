Overcome creative block by using an Oblique Strategy. 

Originally create by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt as a way to encourage lateral thinking, Oblique Strategies were originally available as a stack of cards from which you would draw a random card which held a simple prompt. See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies for more information.

There have been six editions. This extension for Roam Research provides the ability to draw from any of the first five editions, or a combined list containing all of the prompts from the first five editions. The prompts were sourced from https://github.com/noaoh/oblique-stratagems with thanks.

An Oblique Strategy prompt can be obtained using a Command Palette command or Roam Research Hotkey, or by using a SmartBlock command.

The following commands are available:

Random Oblique Strategy
Random Oblique Strategy - 1st Edition
Random Oblique Strategy - 2nd Edition
Random Oblique Strategy - 3rd Edition
Random Oblique Strategy - 4th Edition
Random Oblique Strategy - 5th Edition

SmartBlock commands are as follows:

OBLIQUESTRATEGYED3
OBLIQUESTRATEGYED4
OBLIQUESTRATEGYED5
